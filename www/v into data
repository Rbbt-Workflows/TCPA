_D_e_s_c_r_i_p_t_i_o_n:

     'scale' is generic function whose default method centers and/or
     scales the columns of a numeric matrix.

_U_s_a_g_e:

     scale(x, center = TRUE, scale = TRUE)
     
_A_r_g_u_m_e_n_t_s:

       x: a numeric matrix(like object).

  center: either a logical value or a numeric vector of length equal to
          the number of columns of 'x'.

   scale: either a logical value or a numeric vector of length equal to
          the number of columns of 'x'.

_D_e_t_a_i_l_s:

     The value of 'center' determines how column centering is
     performed.  If 'center' is a numeric vector with length equal to
     the number of columns of 'x', then each column of 'x' has the
     corresponding value from 'center' subtracted from it.  If 'center'
     is 'TRUE' then centering is done by subtracting the column means
     (omitting 'NA's) of 'x' from their corresponding columns, and if
     'center' is 'FALSE', no centering is done.

     The value of 'scale' determines how column scaling is performed
     (after centering).  If 'scale' is a numeric vector with length
     equal to the number of columns of 'x', then each column of 'x' is
     divided by the corresponding value from 'scale'.  If 'scale' is
     'TRUE' then scaling is done by dividing the (centered) columns of
     'x' by their standard deviations if 'center' is 'TRUE', and the
     root mean square otherwise.  If 'scale' is 'FALSE', no scaling is
     done.

     The root-mean-square for a (possibly centered) column is defined
     as sqrt(sum(x^2)/(n-1)), where x is a vector of the non-missing
     values and n is the number of non-missing values.  In the case
     'center = TRUE', this is the same as the standard deviation, but
     in general it is not.  (To scale by the standard deviations
     without centering, use 'scale(x, center = FALSE, scale = apply(x,
     2, sd, na.rm = TRUE))'.)

_V_a_l_u_e:

     For 'scale.default', the centered, scaled matrix.  The numeric
     centering and scalings used (if any) are returned as attributes
     '"scaled:center"' and '"scaled:scale"'

_R_e_f_e_r_e_n_c_e_s:

     Becker, R. A., Chambers, J. M. and Wilks, A. R. (1988) _The New S
     Language_.  Wadsworth & Brooks/Cole.

_S_e_e _A_l_s_o:

     'sweep' which allows centering (and scaling) with arbitrary
     statistics.

     For working with the scale of a plot, see 'par'.

_E_x_a_m_p_l_e_s:

     require(stats)
     x <- matrix(1:10, ncol = 2)
     (centered.x <- scale(x, scale = FALSE))
     cov(centered.scaled.x <- scale(x)) # all 1
